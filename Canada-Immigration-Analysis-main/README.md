# Data-Visualization-project
The dataset used is from the 'IBM Skillbuild Data Visualization with Python' course, detailing immigration to Canada between 1980 and 2013. I carried out data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using NumPy and Pandas to uncover key trends and patterns in Canadian immigration over this period.

For data visualization, I used Matplotlib, a widely-used Python library, to highlight insights related to immigrant demographics, regional distributions, and socio-economic impact. These visualizations help in better understanding the dynamics of immigration to Canada across different years and countries.
